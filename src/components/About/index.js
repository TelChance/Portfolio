          Hello! My name is Chance Telford and I am pretty new to this field! I am 21 years old and I from a town in East Texas called Lufkin.
          Some things I am interested in are fishing, technology, marvel and dc movies, and video games. I am hoping to continue growing my knowledge in this growing career field!
